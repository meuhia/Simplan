Simplann is an online interactive survey. It facilitates decision making and organization of meetings. This tool aims to be as simple as possible for its handling and user friendly!

Like other online software like Doodle: you create a survey (each part of the survey can be affirmed or denied). As such, it is more prescriptive than Doodle, but simpler: we do not have to "get lost" in the options to search for a particular configuration.

You'll struggle to do without once tried
